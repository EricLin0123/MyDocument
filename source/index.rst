Hello, I am 林萬荃 (Lin Wan-Chuan)!
-------------------------------------------

I am a bachelor EE student having a strong passion in PCB layout and embedded system development.  I've used EasyEDA and Kicad to draw footprint, schematic, and layout. I am currently implementing LVGL and FreeRTOS.

And I happen to play accordion as well!
